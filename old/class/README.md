# typeractive


Typeractive is a self-contained digital garden manager. Intended to "just work"
with minimal dependencies, it offers out-of-the-box support for most media types
and a rich set of social tools including blogs, forums, wikis, knowledge bases, 
RSS feeds, mailing lists, and more.

This remarkable flexibility is accomplished with an interface-driven approach
that reaches very deep into the stack. Platform abstractions, data source 
abstraction, and universal dependency injection make it easy to do cool stuff.
